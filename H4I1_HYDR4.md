# Challenge Description :
The challenge instance provides us with an IP address with a specific port. The words **john** and **rockyou** are highlighted.

# Approach :
We use Hydra (command line version) to complete the challenge.
First me mention the attack to be an ssh attack. Then we provide the IP address and user name as 'john', since it was highlighted and was a hint given to us. The password to test is not a single password but a wordlist named as rockyou.txt and is found on the path :
> /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Then we mention the port number and enter y to initiate the attack.

We would then get the password which is 'eminem'.

Next we open a new terminal and enter the following command to gain access to the machine of the given IP address :
> ssh john@15.206.149.154 -p <port_number>

Then we type yes and enter the password cracked through hydra.
 Next we enter the following command to get the flag :
 > cat user.txt
