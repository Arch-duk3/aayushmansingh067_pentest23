# Challenge Description :
We are were given with a webpage asking for a 6-digit otp.

# Approach :
TOTP basically refers to a time based otp, i.e it will expire after a given period of time. This means that the challenge is to be completed within a given time frame. 

Since it is a webpage, thus the answer has to lie within the source code. So the next step was to check the source code. The source code shows the following piece of string :- 
>"TOTP=TVJCVzZaREZFQkJHQzQzRkdNWkE="

Here the jumbled code after 'TOTP=' is a Base 64 encoded message. After decoding the text the plaintext is to be entered in a python code taken from the following webpage :-
https://pyauth.github.io/pyotp/
The python code is as follows :-
>import pyotp
import time
totp = pyotp.TOTP('PlaintextDecodedFromBase64')
totp.now()
print(totp.now())

When the plain text is entered in this piece of python code a 6-digit otp is generated which is to be submited on the webpage so as to get the flag.
