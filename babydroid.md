# Challenge Description :
In this challenge we are given an apk file named as challenge.apk. We have to go through the apk and find the flag hidden in it.

# Approach :
First we install Jadx-gui using the following command on Kali linux:
>sudo apt-get install jadx-gui

After the installation is complete use the following command to run jadx gui :
>jadx-gui

Now select the challenge.apk. This will open all .dex and present it in a readable form. Under the folder recruitment.android.decryptme, we find a file named 'a'.
Here lies a java code which contains the flag. As soon as we decode what string it is building we can get the flag.
