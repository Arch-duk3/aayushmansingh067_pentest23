# Challenge Description :
This is a boot2root CTF challenge. We aren't given many clues just that the answer will lie within the first 1000 ports. We have the IP address mailed to us. Since we have to complete atleast 5 flags before gatting an access to this chanllenge, we have to use our pre-requisite knowledge to solve it.

# Approach :
First we use nmap to get the port that we have to access on this IP address. It can be done by the following command :
>nmap 15.207.72.201 -p- 1000 -sV

This will show us 7 ports in which we will have to use the port 234 which shows that an unknown service is running on it.
Then we use the following command to get the first flag :
>nc 15.207.72.201 234 

This will give us the first flag.

Next we use gobuster to scan through the IP address and give us the files running on it. The following command is used for it :
>gobuster dir -u http://15.207.72.201 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

This will show that a file called robots.txt is running on the IP address. So we type 'http://15.207.72.201/robots.txt' on a web browser and find that There are two more files : 
* login.html
* f1ag.txt

Now we type 'http://15.207.72.201/f1ag.txt' to get the eighth flag.

# Flags Found :
Flag 1 - p3nt35t{M4y_th3_F0rc3_b3_w1th_y0u}
Flag 2 - p3nt35t{7HErEs_AlwAys_4_BI9ger_F1sh}
