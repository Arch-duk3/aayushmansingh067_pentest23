# Challenge Description
We are given the IP address and port number of a remote machine, in which we can only access as an underprivileged user whose credentials are :
>Username : admin
>Password : admin

There are three flags hidden and the final flag is hidden in the following path :
>/root/root.txt

# Approach :
First we gain access of the machine by using the command :
>ssh admin@15.206.149.154 -p <port_number>

Then we type yes and enter the password which is 'admin'.
Now we access the shadow file which is on the path :
>/etc/shadow

We can notice that the encrypted password for admin as well the other user Rick is same, thus Rick's password is also 'admin'.
We can gain access to Rick by using the following command and entering the password 'admin' :
>su Rick

Now we open the user.txt file located on the path :
>/home/Rick/user.txt

This will give us the first flag. It also gives us a hint that the sql database that Rick has may contain some login credentials as Rick is also a hacker. So we type the following command to gain access to Rick's sql databases :
>mysql -h localhost -u Rick -p

Then we enter the following commands to get the credentials for login as Morty :
>show databases;
>use dbrick;
>select*from users;

Then we enter the following command and enter the password 'Tr4c3734' to gain access of Morty :
>su Morty

Now we open the file user.txt located on the path :
>/home/Morty/user.txt

This will give us the second flag.
Now we enter the following command to gain access as the root :
>sudo su

This command works as Morty is a sudoer and can use the command 'sudo'.
Since we now have the root access we can directly open the file root.txt to get the last flag.
