# Challenge Description :
We are given a website which has three other webpages which have the flag. To get the flag, the correct type of xss script is to be inserted in each webpage. The final flag will be shown on the console menu.

# Approach :
When the instance is started, we are directed to a website. The first task is known as Typhon, which asks for the reflected xss script as an attack. The following xss script allows us to get the flag: 
> {img src="" onerror="alert(1)"}

The second task, which is known as Erinyes, used a DOM-based xss, thus the following xss script was used to get the flag:
> {script\x20type="text/javascript">javascript:alert(1);</script}

The third task, which is known as Gorgons, used a  DOM-based xss script. The following xss script was used to get the flag:
> {svg onload=alert(1)}
