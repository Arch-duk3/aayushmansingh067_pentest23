# Challenge Description :
We are given the IP address and port number of a remote system that we have to gain access of to get the flag. The user credentials of the system given to us are :
>Username: admin
>Password: admin

The flag is hidden in the following file :
>/root/root.txt

# Approach :
When we get the IP address and the port number we enter the following command in the terminal :
>ssh admin@15.206.149.154 -p <port_number>

Then we type yes and proceed to enter the password which is 'admin'. Now we can access the sadow file which is on the following path: 
>/etc/shadow

In a new terminal type the following command to download the shadow file on the local machine, i.e your laptop or computer :
>scp -P <port_number> admin@15.206.149.154:/etc/shadow

Then the next step is to use nano command to edit the downloaded shadow file and change the root password with the admin password's ciphertext, which we know then decrypts back to 'admin'.

Then we run the following command to copy the edited shadow file back to the remote machine to make the changes to come in effect :
>scp -P <port_number> /home/aayushman/Desktop/shadow
admin@15.206.149.154:/etc/shadow

Now we go back to the remote machine and enter the command 'su -' and enter the password as admin. Now we will get the access to the root directory and we can easily open root.txt to get the flag.
