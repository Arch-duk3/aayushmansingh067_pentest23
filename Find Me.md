# Challenge Description :
We are given an apk named as challenge.apk and we have to go through it to find the flag hidden in it.

# Approach :
First we install a tool named apktool with the following command :
>sudo apt-get install apktool

After the installation is complete we run the following command to simply unzip the .apk file and view all of its contents :
>apktool d challenge.apk

Next we use the following command to find which file contains the flag as the flag is in the format 'p3n35t' :
>cat * | grep -wR 'p3nt35t'

We get that the binary has matched in the file named as :
* lib/x86_64/libfindme.so

So now we use the strings() command to get the flag :
>strings(challenge/lib/x86_64/libfindme.so)
